## My Projects

## QR code Generator - backend only  

- This project utilizes the **inquirer** npm package to prompt users for input. It then employs the **qr-image** npm package to generate a QR code image based on the URL provided by the user. Finally, it utilizes the native fs node module to create a text file to store the user's input.

<br>

## HTTP Requests  

- HTTP - language that allows computers to talk to each other across the internet.
Request Vocabulary:

  - GET: retrieve information
  - POST: send information
  - PUT: replace resources with new information
  - PATCH: patch up (fix) a resource
  - DELETE: delete existing information of the specified source

---
<br>

## Postman  

### Postman is a tool that allows us to test our backend without needing a frontend. We can test our routes and see what data is being sent back to us

- Test different routes, while the server running with nodemon

---
<br>

## Express Middleware and Custom Middleware

Middleware is a function that runs between the `request` and the `response`.
It can be used for a variety of things, such as logging, authentication, and more.
Middleware functions can be used with the `app.use()` method.

## üìÅ Passing data in EJS

- EJS work almost like having a little JavaScript module that can run JavaScript code inside a HTML file, and it ends with the .ejs file extension.

- And essentially all we've got is just HTML but with bits of JavaScript enclosed inside a special syntax

---

<br>

## üìÅ Formatting API requests

I can call it private API.
If I want my server to talk to someone else's server and back
(get some data, and interact with that server) - it will be also in Request and Response, but this time it's done
via a public API.

## API Authentication

#### Check out the application [here](https://api-authentication-u9xk.onrender.com)

- The API used for this project is `https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com/`
- Basic authentication uses username and password, and base64 encoding to authenticate the user.
- Token-based auth is more secure because we get the user to use a username and password to log in, and once they get in we generate a token, to be used with the API.
  So the API doesn't get involved with the username and password, and instead it's the token that is used to interact with the API.
- Normally I'll see token-based auth as OAuth 2.0, which is a standard for token-based auth.
  In 3rd party apps, I'll see OAuth 2.0. for example, when I log in to a website using my google account, I'll get a token that I can use to interact with the API.  
  (so I don't have to give my username and password of google to the 3rd party app, instead, I give them a token, and they use that token to interact with the API.)

#### Authentication + REST API

- `Basic Authentication` is required for some endpoints. Use your `username and password` to authenticate.
- An `API Key` is required to `Authorize` certain endpoints. Use the API key obtained from the /generate-api-key endpoint.
- `Bearer Token` Authentication is required for some endpoints. Use your `username and password` to get a token obtained from the /get-auth-token endpoint.

#### Difference between Authentication and Authorization

Authentication is the process of `verifying who you are (user`, to the API provider.
Authorization is the process of verifying  what the client is allowed to do. and they get an  `API key to authorize themself`. Allows you to use an API.

## üìÅ Databases -

### SQL DB-

Structured Query language.
some SQL sources: oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite. (free and paid).

### NoSQL DB-

it's possible to change the Structure of the data afterwards.

<br>

## üìÅ postgreSQL + pgAdmin tables

- to connect to the DB we need some details to verify ourselves.
- I use the pg package to connect to the DB and send queries to the DB.
- Then I connect to the DB, and send queries to the DB, with db.query. with SQL code inside (structured query language).
- I use a PostgreSQL server, with pgAdmin DB.
